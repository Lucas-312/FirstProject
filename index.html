    <div class="subtitle">
        <p> Last year, in search of new perspectives, I wandered across many places—Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia,
            Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, and Xinjiang in China.
            With a camera in my hands, I listened to strangers, shared brief conversations,
            and quietly collected fragments of their everyday lives.
            Along the way, I witnessed countless ways of being human:
            those who rush into the morning light for work,
            those who carry their worlds on their backs,
            those surrounded by abundance yet restless inside,
            and those with very little, still holding onto hope.
            Different lives, different rhythms—
            yet everyone is reaching toward a few moments that make living feel meaningful.
            These journeys taught me not only how to see others more clearly, but also how to understand myself, and how
            to loosen my grip on worries that no longer need to be carried.
            So I choose to record these moments,
            and to share them with you
        </p>
